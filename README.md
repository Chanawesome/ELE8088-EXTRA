# ELE8088-EXTRA
## Instructions
Preparation and submission of solutions
(i) Below you will find 26 problems. Solve any 16 of them. If you solve more than 16, only the first 16
will be taken into account; the rest will be ignored. On the first page of your report, list the problems
you attempted to solve (no more than 16).
(ii) Typeset your solutions in LATEX using the template provided on Canvas (read the instructions).
Handwritten and scanned solutions, or solutions written in MS Word or other word processors will
not be accepted. You must read the document “how to write a good technical report.”
(iii) Upload your solutions on Canvas. Note that you will be able to upload a single PDF file only.
(iv) If you have any questions or need a clarification or a hint, you have to post your question on
Canvas as a discussion. Feel free to ask questions. I will not answer any questions by email as this
will not be fair to the other students.
(v) Some questions require the use of software; for example, you may need to write some Python code.
Do not include your code in your solutions. Instead, upload it on github.com or gist.github.com
and provide a link in your solutions. If you use a Google colab notebook, provide a shareable link.
It is your responsibility to ensure that the link is accessible.
(vi) If you have any exceptional circumstances (health problems, or other difficulties), please contact
the advisor of studies, Dr D. McNeill, and submit an exceptional circumstances request.
(vii) Very important note: your report must be self contained: although you can use Python to
solve some of the questions, you must report your results in your report. You cannot say “run
the code to get the results,” or “the results are shown in my Python notebook.” Such results will not
be marked.
(viii) This is an individual assignment.
(ix) Any questions received less than 72 hours before the deadline will not be answered.
(x) Last, but not least, read carefully the document “how to write a good technical report.”
